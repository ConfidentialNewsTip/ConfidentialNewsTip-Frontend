## ConfidentialNewsTip

A privacy-preserving decentralized news platform built on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), allowing users to post news, like posts, and send confidential encrypted tips to creators.

This contract uses Zamaâ€™s FHEVM to ensure that all tipping transactions remain fully encrypted on-chain â€” meaning no one (not even the contract owner) can view the actual tip amounts unless decrypted with the correct proof.

### Features

Post News: Users can share stories with a title and description.

Like And Unlike: Toggle between liking and unliking any post.

Confidential Tipping: Send encrypted tips to news creators using FHE.

Decrypt Tips: News creators can request decryption of total received tips.

Faucet Integration: All tipping operations interact with the Faucet contract for token transfers.
